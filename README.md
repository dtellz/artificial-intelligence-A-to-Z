# Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢

This year I am droping out of College, the learning rate has become limiting to me personally. After finishing a Coding Bootcamp and landing a job as a Junior Solutions Architect (prior some Full Stack Developer Teacher and Freelance Software Developer roles) I have come to realize that I learned more in 1 year by myself than I have done after 2 years and a half of Computer Science and Software Engineering College Degree, plus I already have a Master's Degree in another branch of the Engineering field, it has become a non-sense for me.

After this decision I have set 2 personal goals for this next year; to grow internally in my current company and to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence. By the end of next summer I expect to be a Solutions Architect/Platform Engineer at my current company and to be able to solve real live problems with machine learning delivering it via AI applications.
